    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>HeroMatch is designed to help gamers of all skill levels find characters to play in popular online games.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once you've chosen a game, you will answer some questions about your preferences (e.g. difficulty, role on a team). Then, HeroMatch will provide you with a character that best suits your answers, along with a list of other similar characters. From there, you can select a hero to learn more about them and see why HeroMatch picked them for you.</p>
